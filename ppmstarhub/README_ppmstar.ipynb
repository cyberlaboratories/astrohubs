    "### General note on access and file storage in astrohub\n",
    "<a id='0'></a>\n",
    "* This astrohub server is providing access to collaborators of the Minnesota-UVic PPMstar team (see below).\n",
    "* All users of the astrohub or wendi authenticate individually and are granted access to their individual docker container based on the image they choose in the spawner menu.\n",
    "* All data in the home directory of the instance is private to the individual user and lives inside the docker container. This data will be lost when the user shuts down the instance (via the `Hub` menu $\\rightarrow$ `Control Panel`) but not when the user just logs out or closes the browser.\n",
    "* Read-only data repositories are available under `/data` (see below).\n",
    "* Read-write storage with different distance-access speed properties are available under `/user`. \n",
    "* *Important note:* All users of this server have the unix moniker `user` and are the same on the write-enabled storage under `/user`. This feature  enables seamless and transparent collaboration. It does mean, however, that each user should act reasonably, which means that you would create your own user directory with your name in it and limit your activities to _your_ part of the storage. It also means that you should not put things in `/user` that you do not want any of the other users (see below) to see, or that does not have a copy somewhere else (in case of accidental deletion). A proven way to interact is to keep anything of value in repositories that are frequently pushed to a remote. For this to work smoothly it is advised to setup ssh keys with your remote git server [(instructions for how to organize that in the astrohub context where you may occasionally restart the astrohub application)](https://owncloud.westgrid.ca/index.php/s/jEGCjwhgkfYhEop). We do run a gitlab server and can give you access to unlimited private git repos on that server if needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The GitHub PPMstar repo\n",
    "<a id='1'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data access is through our python modules, most notably the repositories _PPMnotebooks_ and _PyPPM_. \n",
    "* _PPMnotebooks_  is a collection of example notebooks that demonstrate the use of the PyPPM tools and also contain for some PPMstar papers the notebooks used to make the figures in the paper. \n",
    "* _PyPPM_ contains the `ppm.py` module, the 10,000-line work horse to analyse and access the data output products of the PPMstar code. \n",
    "* *Important note:* If you do develop new plot types or analysis methods that you think may be useful to other users you are encouraged to feed those back into the `PyPPM` package via a fork and pull request. That would be much appreciated!"
