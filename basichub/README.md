# Basic application

This is a [cyberhub](https://github.com/cyberlaboratories/cyberhubs)
application that can be deployed in conjunction with a
corehub/multiuser installation. See [cyberhub
documentation](https://github.com/cyberlaboratories/cyberhubs/blob/master/README.md).

The Basic cyberhubs application provides a number of tools and
utilities (python and Linux) that most other applications will need.
